##New Project Builing ETL pipeline in Python

Pulling live stock data with Alpha Vantage, cleaning and normalizing data, storing in json and CSV format

Notes:
  Json files contain the API request metadata, the csv files do not.
  Master metadata file is going to be used in automation to check if another pull should be run

  main.py will generate all the data into a raw_data folder, not uploaded to avoid bloated repo
